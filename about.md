Hello, I'm Duncan, and I can talk to both people and
computers.

I’m the Technical Architect at [dxw](https://www.dxw.com/).
That title means different things at different companies, but at dxw it means
I spend most of my time in
[Vim](https://github.com/dgmstuart/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc)
writing code, and the rest of my time time talking
to customers and end users about what we should be building.

I've been involved in making software and websites for a while. You can find out about
that on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/duncangmstuart) or check out my
shiny responsive [CV](https://dgmstuart.github.io/dgms_cv/).

You’ll can find me on other social networks too, like [twitter](https://twitter.com/dgmstuart), and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dgmstuart/).

In my spare time I’m mostly swing dancing and rebuilding [Swing Out
London](http://www.swingoutlondon.co.uk/).

I'm very interested in the whole teaching kids to code thing. I volunteer some Saturdays
at [Wizzie Wizzie Computer Coding Club](http://www.wizziewizzie.org/)
and I run a meetup for
[People teaching kids to code in London](http://www.meetup.com/People-teaching-kids-to-code-in-London/).
