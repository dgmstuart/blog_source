* Not a coder, but a scientist
* Will try to explain why the gender inequality in our industry exists
* Messages growing up:
  * on the one hand message from rocket scientist father that being a
  scientist was a good goal for a woman
  * On the other hand, birthday gifts between her (clothing, crafting) and her
  brother (tinkering, electrical engineering) were very gendered
* why does this happen? Why do parents make these choices (despite their
actual values)
* At university, message was: 'because you don't know soldering, you don't
belong on a physics degree
* unconscious bias

* Women in CS peaked in around 1970 (30-ish%) and has been declining ever
since
* Similar stories in politics, film etc.
* "for a lot of people this doesn't seem to be a problem"
  * Rationale: we have parity of education and opportunity, so it must just be
  because women aren't interested in these roles
* Research: companies with more women, particularly on boards, massively
outperform other companies "on every metric that business cares about"
* There are undeniable good reasons, so why is there still such inequality
* All of us, male and female are unconsciously gender-biased.
  * Until we learn how to bring these to the conscious level it's going to
  continue to be a problem
* Brains encode associations based on what they perceive - irrespective of
accuracy etc.
  * We make decisions about people immediately based on appearance
  * Most of the time this is OK: these biases are shortcuts.
  * Things go wrong when these biases stop working (stop being accurate)
* Brain will always prefer to take the shortcut to free up brainpower for
other tasks
* Unconscious associations can be tested by matching up traditionally gendered
qualities with images of the opposite gender and measuring the difficulty of
each pairing
* Mothers overestimate the crawling ability of boys and underestimate that of
girls
* Women's code on github PRs was accepted about 4% more than men's (unless the
gender could be inferred from their profile, which reversed the trend)
* Women are more likely to attribute their success to luck, men to hard work
* Confidence and likeability are positively correlated for men, and negatively
correlated for women
* 2 environments for a Computer Science classroom: one neutrally decorated,
one geekily decorated. No difference in impact on Men's interest in the
subject, but the latter significantly reduced the interest in the course of
the female participants
* How to fix it? Focus on creating a neutral environment - consider all
aspects: decor, imagery etc.
