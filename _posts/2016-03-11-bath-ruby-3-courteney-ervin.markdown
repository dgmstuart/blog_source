* self-love: take an active effort to love yourself, including strengths and
weaknesses.
* 'should' is this feeling of obligation and intimidation that prevents people
from participating.
* Give yourself permission to write open source code
* Think about what your role is: what do you particularly want to get out of
open source code.
  * Have code that you can show people (if your organisation's code is 100%
  private)
  * to get to know a new tech by interacting with a real project that people
  will actually use
  * fixing a problem you really care about
  * working with/learning from developers you look up to

* My personal goal:
  * learn about how real-world problems are solved pragmatically
* Contributions to open source can be much broader than actual code -
publicising, documentation, tutorials etc.
  * also code maintenance: refactoring, deployment, installation instructions
* different ways to search for projects based on why you're looking:
  * openhatch, codetriage, codemontage
  * Hashtags - #first-timers-only, #help-wanted etc.
  * `#protips`:
    * make sure the project is actually maintained (and so you have a chance
    of getting merged)
    * Call dibs on the issue - v. frustrating if you work on something and
    someone else fixes it first
    * First PR could be fixing issuses with installation of a dev environment
    for a project
    * be clear that you want feedback - give permission to the maintainer so
    that they're not afraid of putting you off
* open source is not a requirement: if it doesn't work for you, you're not
obliged to do stuff for free!
  * If it makes you feel bad, don't do it
